    Efforts:
    * speed working though codecademy JS lessons
    * still trying to understand React code stuff

Sprint 2:
    New Notion link to all my web notes:
        https://fate-snowdrop-547.notion.site/Web-Dev-Learning-e7dc038701304263a494893c488ce0f3
    Note: 
        HTML Notes and CSS Notes were both things I did over the summer.
    
    Efforts: 
    * Now 76% through free Codecademy JS tutorials
    * Found a pretty good tutorial on React to work on:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=874s

Sprint 3:
    Notion link from before still is it:
        * started adding to my React notes
    
    Efforts:
        * Tried to open up a branch and try to create a main page and discovered
        * that I don't know squat.

        * Now I'm working on the React codecademy tutorial for a bit
        * and what I've been learning is in the notes.
