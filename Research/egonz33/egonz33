React Router Tutorial
Intro

Installatin - use StackBlitz
(Could also use a bundler)
Connecting the URL - (connect app to browser's URL)
Add Some Links - import Links 
Add Some Routes-
Nested Routes- Nest the routes inside of the app route, Render an outlet.
Listing the invoices- Import Invoices
Adding a "No Match" Route- always handle a no match case
Reading URL params- Normally would be prop; Create a new <Route> inside of the invoices route
Index Routes- we can fix blank space with Index Routes
Active Links- Use 'Link' instead of 'NavLink'; style from object to function that returns Object;
Search Params- 'useSearchParams' (shows and sets the state in the URL), this is similar to 'React.useState()'
Custom Behavior- Links can be styled as active or inactive
Navigating Programmatically- 'useLocation' 'location.search'
